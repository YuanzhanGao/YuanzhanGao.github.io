This is Yuanzhan Gao's personal website. The original contribution is below.
As of 8/22/2023, the original template has been modified greatly by me with
many additional CSS and Javascript codes added. I consider this personal project
to be a showcase of my skills in front-end development rather than just a simple
online portofolio.

After a somewhat extended break from HTML5 UP (to work on a secret-ish new project --
more on that later!) I'm back with a brand new design: Solid State, a slick new multi-
pager that combines some of the ideas I've played with over at Pixelarity with an "angular"
sort of look. Hope you dig it :)
